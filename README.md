# Goal
My main goal was to build a simple calculator using react and the useState hook to handle state within the app.

# Description
This is a simple calculator app that will provide the user with the functionality of an everyday calculator. I am using React to build out the user interface, managing state with the useState react hook. I also made a custom react hook to access the user's previous input to display on the calculator. Npm is being used for my package manager and pure CSS for styling.

# User Story

As a user, I need a calculator to evaluate simple math problems.

As a user, I want to be able to use the multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operations for evaluating.

As a user, I want to be able to delete a single input and/or clear all inputs.

As a user, I want my calculator to show my previous input above my current input so I can keep track of my inputs.
